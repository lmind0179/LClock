# Leading Clock ‚è∞


A beautiful, minimalist, and highly customizable clock app for iOS. Designed for focus, style, and OLED screen protection.

## Features

* **Multiple Themes:** Choose from 4 unique analog and 3 stylish digital clock themes to match your mood.
* **OLED Burn-in Protection:** To protect your screen, the clock interface gently shifts its position every 3 minutes.
* **Gesture-Based Brightness:** Intuitively control the UI brightness by sliding your finger up or down the screen.
* **Persistent Memory:** Your last-used theme, brightness, and display settings are always saved for the next launch.
* **Fully Responsive:** Looks great in both portrait and landscape mode, automatically scaling the UI to fit any screen without clipping.
* **Minimal Interface:** Tap the screen to reveal settings; otherwise, the interface (including the status bar) is hidden for maximum focus.

## Technology

* **Framework:** 100% SwiftUI
* **Storage:** `AppStorage` for persistent user settings.
* **Async:** `Combine` framework (`Timer.publish`) for the pixel-shift functionality.
